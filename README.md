Climate change is happening. Neither political party can deny that. Every day, weather changes in every area on the planet. The question is not whether climate hange is happening or not. The question is whether climate change should be considered as big of a deal as it is right now. Is it an urgent issue, or not?

<strong>Thesis Statement:</strong> Climate change is an overstated problem used by democrats in politics today as a tactic to get what they want: more regulation, more control of the economy, more redistribution of wealth, and skepticism towards capitalism/America's current status as an affluent superpower.

8% of republicans with a college level education or higher worry about climate change a great deal. That number decreases each year. This is because they know that the earth has been around for 4.5+ billion years, and the climate is always changing. From 2.6 million years ago to 11,700 years ago, earth was undergoing its most recent ice age. Democrats believe it is a very urgent and current political issue, although the rumored "consequences" of human action would not be very serious for thousands of years. There is not much scientific evidence that proves humans are the primary cause of climate change. In 2010 Climate Depot released a report featuring more than 1,000 scientists, several of them former UN IPCC scientists, who disagreed that humans are primarily responsible for global climate change. The 2012 Cook Review revealed that 66.4% of scientific studies denied major human impact on climate. A 2012 Purdue University survey found that 47% of climatologists challenge the idea that humans are primarily responsible for climate change. Democrats are so concerned about the carbon dioxide that we emit, yet plants need carbon dioxide to survive, and without plants, we would not have the oxygen we need to survive. Democrats want to increase government spending to "stop climate change", but that is impossible. The climate will always change every day, and 7 billion humans can't stop the earth's (which has a mass of 5,972,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg) climate from changing.

On the other hand, 50% of democrats with a college level of education or higher worry about climate change a great deal. That number increases each year. This is because they see the scientific evidence that climate change is happening and they want to do anything they can to stop it before it worsens. They believe that humans have a large impact on climate change, due to the 70+ million carbon dioxide compound increase over the past 75 years. They worry about carbon dioxide a great deal, as they believe it is a chemical that harms the environment. Since democrats are very passionate about preserving the environment and keeping our earth green, climate change has been lumped into the democratic political campaigns instead of remaining a battle of the scientists. Democrats believe that climate change should stay as big of an issue as it is as of now, if not grow even bigger. This is because they believe that drastic changes in climate are slowly but surely negatively impacting the world and that the climate is changing now more than ever.
